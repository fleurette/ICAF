            <div class="children-are-creators">We believe that children are creators and builders of the future. Their
                imagination is social capital and their art opens a window into their world. Children's voices should be
                heard all around, from boardrooms and town halls to the Congress and the UN. Their art should be in
                every
                contemporary art museum and on the walls of each business office. You can help us empower the children
                by
                reforming education to foster creativity and infuse it with empathy.</div>
