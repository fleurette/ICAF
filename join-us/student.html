                Art is a discipline that offers many benefits and foremost is how the arts
                grow your imagination. Through imagination, you generate ideas, and ideas
                are the engine of today's global economy.<br>
                The arts also foster creativity
                through experimentation and identification of feasible ideas. You live in
                the creative age. By embracing creativity, you can embark on a journey to
                create and innovate. You need to be creative as a scientist, technologist,
                engineer, or mathematician.<br><br>

                When you embrace empathy, you begin to see others not as competitors or
                enemies, but colleagues with whom you can collaborate and co-create.

                    <li>Global education is becoming increasingly important. One way to
                        learn about other cultures is by examining the art produced by
                        children around the world. You will see some amazing works in
                        our gallery. </li>

                        event in your school. Maybe auction your own art or do something
                        creative to help the ICAF expand its Arts Olympiad, produce the
                        WCF, and publish the ChildArt magazine. Creative individuals like
                        you can help nurture the creativity of all your peers around the
                        globe.</li>
