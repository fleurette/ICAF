        <div class="description">
            <p>Volunteers are the heart and soul of charity organizations such as ICAF, which struggle with the paucity
                of funding available to promote children&rsquo;s imagination and art.</p>

            <p>More than 500 volunteers have helped ICAF since its founding in 1997. Today, volunteers help as
                accountants, assistant editors, curators, curricula developers, designers, event planners, fundraising
                experts, graphic artists, strategic marketing professionals, UX designers, web developers, and
                volunteers at the World Children&rsquo;s Festival. Some volunteers have helped ICAF for a whole year or
                several years.</p>

            <p>About 360 students have helped the children by interning for ICAF since 1997. Interns work as program,
                social media, IT, or PR officers.</p>

            <p>Please let us know how you can help.</p>
