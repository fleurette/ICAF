 <div class="description">
    While independently ranked among the 25 Top Children's Charities in the United States, ICAF's tenous financial position  reflects the lack of 
understanding of business, philanthropic, and political Leaders of the critical importance of 
creativity and empathy, and the urgency to develop these vital human traits for a prosperous and peaceful future.

    <!-- 5% Overhead -->

    <div class="section-titles">5% Overhead</div>
    <div class="sections"> 
        Because a network of volunteers nationwide and worldwide help ICAF conduct its programs and organize its festivals and exhibitions, ICAF overhead expenses are traditionally less than 5%.
        Hence, nearly all charitable contributions directly fund educational programs and events.
    </div>

        <div class="section-titles">Zero Service Revenue</div>
        <div class="sections">
             Unconventionally, ICAF's programs are free of charge, its magazine is free of commercial advertisements, and its World Children's Festival is free and open to the public. ICAF does not earn any revenue from the services it provides, which makes the charity entirely dependent 
        on donations and yet ICAF does not spend any money on fundraising.
        </div>

        <div class="section-titles">Integrity</div>
        <div class="sections">
             ICAF has earned a reputation for financial integrity and efficiency. ICAF has earned the 2022 GuideStar Platinum Transparency ranking. ICAF takes stewardship seriously and 
            works to maximize the value of every contribution received.
        </div>

<div class="section-titles">Rejections</div>

    The private foundations that rejected ICAF's 2022 grant applications include Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, Hirschfeld Family Foundation, The Kahlert Foundation, F.M. Kirby Foundation, Dr. Robert C. and Tina Sohn Foundation, and Prince Charitable Trusts. In 2022, 
    businesses that rejected ICAF's request for support include Adobe, Epson, and Zoom.
