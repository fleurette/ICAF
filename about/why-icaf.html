            <div class="section-titles">Problem Statement</div>
            <div class="sections">Creativity researcher KH Kim found that American creativity declined from the 1990s to
                2008, and the slide since 2008 may even be worse. Creativity guru Ken Robinson averred that children get
                schooled out of their creativity. E. Paul Torrance, widely regarded as the &ldquo;father&rdquo; of
                creativity, discovered the &ldquo;4th -grade&rdquo; in children&rsquo;s creativity. Once this slump
                gains a foothold, it holds back divergent and critical thinking that propels invention and innovation.
                <br>
                <br>
                Though creativity is treated as something inherently positive, it is morally neutral. Malevolent or dark
                creativity intentionally harms the perceived opponents or outgroups. What makes creativity positive for
                the advancement of the human species and the protection of planet Earth? Empathy. Primatologist Frans de
                Waal defines empathy as humankind &ldquo;survival package&rdquo;. Empathy could well be the mother of
                all emotions.
                <br>
                <br>
                Recent neuroscientific findings portray the human brain as a creative powerhousehardwired for empathy
                because of &ldquo;mirror neurons&rdquo;. Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) or the transmission of
                fear, hatred, or trauma passed from one generation to the next, like physical traits or melanin, can
                muddy the mirror neurons, making activation necessary.
            </div>
            <div class="section-titles">Why the arts?</div>
            <div class="sections">In its 2021 report: Art for Life&rsquo;s Sake: The Case for Arts Education, the
                American Academy of Arts & Sciences provides &ldquo;evidence of the attributes, values, and skills that
                come from arts education, including social and emotional development, improvements in school engagement,
                as well as vital civic and social participation.&rdquo; In sum, the arts can change a person. Art
                programs are also cost effective compared to other interventions. Notably, the concepts of creativity
                and empathy are both rooted in the arts; hence, the arts can help develop these vital human attributes.
            </div>
            <div class="section-titles">Theory of Change</div>
            <div class="sections">Founded in 1997 to serve American children as their national arts organization and the
                world&rsquo;s children as their global arts organization, the International Child Art Foundation (ICAF)
                is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit with Federal Tax ID 52-2032649.
                <br>
                <br>
                Mission: To cultivate American children&rsquo;s creativity and grow mutual empathy among them and their
                peers worldwide as building blocks for a prosperous and peaceful future.
                <br>
                <br>
                Vision: To democratize creativity for the Fourth Industrial Revolution and mainstream
                mutual empathy for &ldquo;a more perfect union&rdquo;.
                <br>
                <br>
                ICAF&rsquo;s programmatic approach is based on the belief that creativity can be learned while empathy
                can be taught. Its unique pedagogy for children&rsquo;s creative and empathic development draws upon
                over twenty-five years of experience working with youth nationwide and worldwide. By employing the arts
                as a dynamic activity, ICAF helps children reframe their self-identity, first as
                &ldquo;artist-athletes&rdquo;
                for
                self-improvement, then as &ldquo;creative-empaths&rdquo; for positive social change.
            </div>
            <div class="section-titles">The Arts Olympiad</div>
            <div class="sections">ICAF&rsquo;s Arts Olympiad has grown over the years into the world&rsquo;s largest
                school art program. The Arts Olympiad inspires students to embrace the &ldquo;Artist-Athlete
                Ideal&rdquo; of the creative mind and healthy body (mente sana in corpo sano). Through structured lesson
                plans, ICAF awakens the dormant &ldquo;inner-artists&rdquo; and the slumbering
                &ldquo;inner-athletes&rdquo; for students to begin thinking of themselves and others as
                &ldquo;artist-athletes&rdquo; â€” not jocks, nerds, techies, or artsy. This revised self-image solidifies
                when students limn themselves as artist-athletes in the artwork they produce under the Arts Olympiad.
                <br>
                <br>
                Blending the artistic and the athletic mindsets nurtures creativity, builds confidence, and boosts
                resilience, enabling students to overcome fears, anxieties, or adverse childhood experiences (ACEs).
                <br>
                <br>
                Creativity is a leadership skill for the privileged but a survival skill for the poor because it levels
                the playing field and can empower disadvantaged students to break the vicious cycle of intergenerational
                poverty.
            </div>
            <div class="section-titles">World Children&rsquo;s Festival</div>
            <div class="sections">ICAF brings together young artist-athletes from across America and nearly 100
                participating countries to its festivals, traditionally held at The National Mall across the U.S.
                Capitol. ICAF choreographs the festival&rsquo;s workshops, activities, and training to produce a
                transformative experience that infuses creativity with empathy through co-creation and collaborative
                mural-making.
                <br>
                <br>
                Once emboldened as &ldquo;creative-empaths&rdquo;, children can disrupt the intergenerational
                transmission of trauma and hatred to work together with outgroups for a prosperous and peaceful future.
