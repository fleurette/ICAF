                                      colors at my high school,   call success. As for me, passion for art was not something I
                                      where I was continuously   chose, but rather something that chose me at some point in my
                                      crisscrossing between    life, and shaped me ever since. The moment I stepped onto

                                      I could find my basic scale.   happen right in front of me, all of my insecurities and fears
                                      Once I discovered it, most of   of being in that new place faded away. I realized that it
                                      my grays became colored,   wasn’t a competition of talents anymore, it was a world of
                                      and I began striving for   children, a place of knowledge and most of all, a nation of
                                      something else to complete   friendship. That festival helped me evolve as a young artist.

                                      Through the activities I was   to speak on the ‘world stage’—where groups of talented

                                      as a youth worker and as a   House. As for me, I realized that no story is the same, even if it

                                      yellows and blues.       in two distinct ways: as a participant and as a workshop leader
