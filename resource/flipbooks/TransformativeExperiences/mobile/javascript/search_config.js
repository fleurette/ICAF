The idea behind the Olympiad was simple:                     Create an innovative lesson plan for schools worldwide so that                    every student can learn about creativity and empathy and then                     produce art on a single theme.

I still remember seeing many large, white tents being set               up that morning to prepare for the wonderful festival. By               the afternoon, the tents were full of children of all ages               from around the world. I met many students from around               the world and shared my knowledge of origami. They               were so talented, eager to learn, and drawn to new ideas               and techniques. Teaching them reminded me of when I               started origami when I was young.                I began folding origami when I was seven and it has since               been one of my main forms of art. Origami allows me to               visualize how geometric shapes can interact with each               other to create unique complex sculptures. Through years               of experimentation, I have learned that the paper medium               is highly flexible. Even complicated polyhedra such as               icosahedron and dodecahedron are easily replicable. I               won a Scholastic Art Awards National Gold Medal in the               sculpture category through an origami piece.                Since the WCF I have become inspired to apply my               origami skills into other fields such as sculpture and               architecture. I had become fascinated with the transition   One challenge I currently face is trying to start my own               of different styles of architecture. So I said to myself:   clothing brand.

The school has over 1,200 pupils.               My first visual arts teacher taught us that day-dreaming is               a great way to expand our imagination. That we should be               curious about things around us. Without imagination and               curiosity, your piece of art will never be as good.                My uncle has influenced me the most. He always tells me               different stories, takes me to discover the other side of               Hong Kong, and draws with me. My six-year-old cousin               influences me a lot, too. He’s one of the most creative               persons I’ve ever met. He is always asking questions that               make me think all day and night.               Winning the 5th Arts Olympiad in Hong Kong is               definitely one of my greatest accomplishments. During               my trip to Washington, DC and at the WCF, I met a lot of               nice people who love art like me. Talking to all the kids and               looking at their paintings inspired me a lot. I learnt to never               stop doing what I like. We do not know each other at first,               but because of the program, we met, we shared our views               and got inspired. Art is not just art, it is communication,               inspiration, point of view, and a bridge that links us all up.                 My personal ambition is to travel around the world. I want               to meet different people and understand different cultures.               I’ll put all of my experience in a journal and publish a book               to spread and share it with the world.

I am a classical pianist               completing my Ph.D. in classical music and I have written               and composed music for seven years. I remember when               I was a child my mother would show me albums of great               painters. I became interested in art and later I became               very fond of music.                Mrs. Domnica Pepelea taught me how to play the piano,               how to perform on a stage, how to control my feelings in               a competition and then the Piano Olympics. She was my               teacher for twelve years. We also prepared my recitals in               Washington DC. I am very thankful to Mr. Ashfaq Ishaq,               who gave me the chance to be a part of these major               events. He surely influenced my career. My both American               experiences—the 2003WCF and the 2007WCF—were life               lessons and I still dream about those great festival days.                Challenges are everywhere but they require patience.               When I started to produce my own music seven years               ago, I also begun using the computer in a manner that               amazed me more than my parents. To succeed I have to               play music and then to produce it right, in complicated               Digital Audio Workstations. After many tutorials and               hours spent to achieve the perfect sound, exactly as with               my instrument, I made my own studio now and there is               nothing more beautiful than going to bed with your head               full of your own lines and music.                The International Child Art Foundation had a sizable role               in my education. I first met many other children coming               from very different cultures and I learnt that the languages               don’t count. My best friend in the 2003WCF was a girl               from Bahrain, who didn’t speak English. Painting had               brought us together and it was much stronger than words.               After a great experience in 2003, I was so honored to be               an ICAF Youth Board Member. It is amazing that after               so many years, I still stay in touch with children that I               have met when I was a kid. Washington and ICAF are               now a part of me.

From               elementary school to high school, I always seemed to find               myself with either a paintbrush or textbook in hand. My               personal ambition and dream is to be able to spread the               essentiality of global empathy—it is my personal belief               that art is a medium through which we can create such a               broadening of perspectives.                My parents truly fostered an environment that was               enriching for my sense of imagination and curiosity.               As a child, they constantly supported any ideas I had               that seemed “out-of-the-box” or required any sort of               imagination. To further this, they always took the family to               visit interesting destinations that stimulated my curiosity,               such as interactive museums and scientific laboratories.               I still continue to challenge myself in my everyday life by               implementing what I’ve learned from my parents.                One of my greatest accomplishments was working with               children and adults from around the world at a workshop               during the World Children’s Festival. Participants of the               workshop worked together to create a large collage out of               folded paper cranes, and on those cranes were messages   While you’re still young, broaden your knowledge and               of well-being to all those around the world.

I have made art for                                         as long as I can remember and I continue to be an active member of the Toronto arts                                         community by participating in group art shows and painting murals. My early love of                                         nature also drove me to seek a Ph.D. at the University of Toronto and Royal Ontario                                         Museum where I am studying the evolutionary history of South American riverine fishes.                                         My ambition is to merge my natural history research and art in a way that allows me to                                         effectively communicate the wonder of nature and the importance of preserving it through                                         biological illustrations, paintings, and murals.                                          My mother encouraged me to make art and become involved in local and international                                         art events from a very young age (I was 9 when I attended my first international art                                         event—the ICAF festival) and was heavily involved in helping me find and pursue these                                         opportunities. On the other hand, my father would take us on hikes and to explore nature,                                         and his own bewilderment and curiosity was contagious. As I grew older, my parents                                         were just as supportive of my bringing home dead animals to study and draw and of me                                         going to the jungle to further my exploration.                                          Together, art and science taught me how to be more observant and curious. Early on in                                         my studies my art and science took the form of reproduction. I painted from pictures and                                         repeated what I was told in lecture. Now, as a graduate student, I exercise my imagination                                         much more: I create my own scenes that depict an idea or feeling when I paint, and in my                                         research I design approaches to expand our knowledge of the natural world.                                          A big challenge that I have faced up to this point is being a girl in two male-dominated                                         fields. One day I was doing a group mural when an interviewer asked me, “How does                                         it feel to be one of the only girls here today?” I actually had not noticed until it was                                         pointed out to me, but I have not been able to “not notice” it again. When I started my                                         Ph.D. I realized that, again, I was one of a few women fish biologists, especially among                                         those who do research in the jungles of the tropics. Though I have not been outwardly                                         discriminated against for being a women by my male peers, the long history of men in                                         both art and science have resulted in some challenges that are unique to women in these                                         fields with regards to career development, personal awareness, and self-esteem.                                          The ICAF gave me my first introduction to being a member of the International                                         community. It gave me the opportunity to meet people from all over the world that                                         shared my love of art, and in doing so, taught me at a very young age that creativity                                         has no bounds and that ideas only get better when we share them with people with                                         different world experiences. Today I continue to take an international approach to my                                         art and research by seeking inspiration from the human and natural world at large and by                                         collaborating with educators and researchers at institutions in other countries.                                          As winner from Canada of ICAF’s very first art program, Viviana represented her country                                         at the ICAF’s very first festival. She then joined the ICAF Youth Board and was an emcee                                         at two other World Children’s Festivals. Now 26 years old, she is completing her Ph.D. in                                         evolutionary biology of tropical freshwater fishes at the University of Toronto.           18  ChildArt    January -March 2017","1999WCF                      Margaret Eloisa                                             Ticlla Ccenhua                                 Art to Resoration                       From the National School of Fine Arts of Peru, I obtained               a bachelors in fine arts, with a specialization in painting.               I work for the city art gallery “Pancho Fierro”—a non-               commercial space to promote cultural activities in the               historical center of Lima. These cultural activities include               hosting art exhibitions, conferences and workshops. I am               preparing my path for advanced studies in restoration and               conservation of cultural patrimony.                I collaborated as a sculpture restorer of the Municipal               Theater of Lima, which had been closed for many years               due to a fire. The restored theater is one of the most               beautiful theatres in Latin America and a venue for               national and international artists.                When I was 12 years old, I had the opportunity to               participate in the ICAF’s first World Children’s Festival               in Washington D.C. This was the first time I traveled               abroad, to a place far, far away. We were thousands               of children from around the world. It was a wonderful               experience even if we could not communicate through our               mother tongues. I guess our paintings were our way to               communicate with each other and the world.                Meeting these children awakened my curiosity for               other cultures and for learning other languages. I               consider that this experience motivated me to study               art. It made me see art as a way to express how much   strong but it does not make the learning process               we love, care and respect what is surrounding us,   easier.

Everything called my attention               and understanding. I believed that there should be things more               real, more live, more colorful than the things I could actually see               around me. So I started touching everything, every material and               felt them. I took them by hand, touched or tasted the materials,               cut them or ripped them. Then my surroundings, people around               me and nature became wonders to me and I started drawing on               everything I could find—papers, notebooks, newspapers and               even the walls and floors. Clothes, curtains, journals, everything I               happily cut apart to make a new artistic creation. For my brothers               and sisters it was obvious that I was an undisciplined child.               My sister was interested in paintings and would tell me about               famous artists. When she told me Leonardo Da Vinci, I felt               a passion to become someone like him and to make great               artworks equivalent to his and within that dream I saw myself               been called ‘The Great Mongolian Artist Ariuntuya’ in the history               of arts. These things influenced my artistic career a lot. My               father happily supported me when he heard I wanted to become               a famous artist.

Children take things as they are and express themselves without               wearing a mask. That is why their expressions convey pure,               precise, and important messages to the world. On the other               hand, experience of feeling and building art play important role               for their future.                To create new things, to be able to see from different               perspectives, to enjoy beauty and to adapt to new               circumstances with distinct impressions are the abilities we can               learn from art and this makes life more rich and more interesting   they learn to appreciate beauty and to understand aesthetics,               and helps us to be positive.                      so their view of the world becomes brighter.

That event may have also been what planted the seed in my parents’ and my head               that art was a thing that I could one day do for my livelihood.”                                                                                                           icaf.org  25","1998 ChildArt USA                                                                                                                “                                                        To receive an invitation at that age and                                                    that time to go to Washington DC, have                                                   my artwork exhibited, meet other artists                                                   from around the country, see the National                                                    Monuments; it was an incredible experience                                                    for so many different reasons as an artist but                                                   also as a person.”               26  ChildArt    January -March 2017","1998 ChildArt USA                    Camilla Cohen                                  Art to Law                     When I first found out that I had won the ICAF competition I   issue and I think that the interplay between being hopeful, but               was in middle school, and at that time my family had recently   also being cognizant of the challenges was kind of the purpose               emigrated from South Africa to Florida. One of the main reasons   of that painting and where I was going with it. This kind of sounds               why my family left and came to America, like so many other   depressing for maybe a 9 year old, but I remember thinking at               people, was to provide us with opportunities. To receive an   the time being very aware of what was going on in the world but,               invitation at that age and that time to go to Washington   hopeful that we were moving toward a better world.               DC, have my artwork exhibited, meet other artists from               around the country, see the National Monuments; it was an   Camilla’s message for you: I think enjoying art and doing art is               incredible experience for so many different reasons as an   a very special thing and if it’s something that you’re passionate               artist but also as a person.                      about put all of your energy into it and do everything you can                                                                 to foster and nurture that talent. Don’t let anyone tell you that               It definitely left an impression on me for the rest of my life and   you shouldn’t be an artist or you shouldn’t pursue that because               also for my family. At that time my mom, grandmother, and   people that are successful in this would pursue things that make               brother had come with me to Washington and it was really   them most happy. If art is that for you, than that is something you               special. I definitely still remember it and art has always been   should devote every hour of your life to. What I took away from               a part of my life. When I was younger, I did it as a way to   my experience with the International Child Art Foundation was               express myself and as I grew older it was also an expression   that there are other people out there all around the world from               but a passion as well. Even though I didn’t end up doing art   different countries that love art just as much as you do and also               as a career, it’s still a part of my life. I still paint, I still draw, I   have something to say about it which is really incredible. So if               still discuss art with my mom, I visit exhibitions, and I go to   sometimes you think you are different just remember that there               museums. It’s like the love of my life.           are thousands of other people out there all across the world that                                                                 are just like you.               Once I graduated from college I ended up with Teach for America               in Spanish Harlem, New York City. For those two years it was   The making of the America Mural was incredible! There was               interesting to see what the teenagers were going through at that   this moment when we all had different perspectives, but we               time. My favorite moments of teaching were the times I had to   were all coming together, unified. In that moment, while there               interact with students and be a voice of reason in their lives,   were among difference amongst us, what was common was               when maybe they felt like they couldn’t speak to their parents or   art. It was a really cool experience.               didn’t have anyone to talk to about their fears or dreams. It was               a great experience. Eventually I decided that I wanted to pursue   Camilla Cohen, Esq. works with a law firm in Florida. She               my other dream which was going to law school. I did that after   represents policyholders against insurance companies who               teaching for two years and now practice law.      show bad faith and sues them for contractual damages. In 1998,                                                                 Camilla represented Florida at the first national arts festival in US               And I love it! The creativity never ends. It’s funny because I think   history hosted by the ICAF on The National Mall and the Ronald               as an artist I bring a different perspective to law in a profession   Reagan Building and International Trade Center.               that most people would think is filled with people who are much               more linear in their thinking. My background in art has given               me a different perspective on how I approach situations and               analyze issues. Law is challenging in a different way than art.               Everyday I’m learning, and everyday I’m growing. Until it stops               being rewarding, I won’t do law, but for right now it’s rewarding               in a different way. Art feeds my creative passion, and law feeds a               different curiosity that I always had as well.                As a child, and still as an adult, you have hope that we’re               progressing and moving towards a better good. I remember               that the rose colored glasses represented that and I was looking               through them and there was a rainbow. I also remember the               picture had a lot of realistic concerns we had in the world at that               time and unfortunately that we still have. Issues like HIV.  I came               from a country where the aids epidemic was disastrous and the               average life expectancy of someone was dramatically lower than               it is in more developed countries. So for me, that was a very real                                                                                                             icaf.org  27","1998 ChildArt USA                          Carson Beyl                                    Art to Design                    After graduating from college I spent several years in New York               City as a designer for Comedy Central \& MTV Networks. This past               summer I decided to leave New York and travel south to pursue my               own design projects—creating a limited-edition line of hats and a               newsprint magazine. These projects led me to my current job as               graphic designer for a small company called Seltzer Goods located               in Asheville, North Carolina.                Right now I am trying to find happiness and beauty in simplicity. I               think that would also be my dream for the world.                My greatest accomplishment is that I am able to create and design               things for a living. It is what I loved most when I was little, and it is               still what I love most in life.                My own personal challenge has been that I have always been quiet               and most comfortable observing the world rather than speaking up.               As I get older I am learning to value these qualities while still pushing               myself to speak my mind when something needs to be said.                The ICAF inspired my first thoughts on politics and things               beyond my very insular 8 year old world. It helped to teach               me that art and design have the power to deliver important               messages to the world.                You should never stop making things and never stop coming up with               ideas. Everyone is happiest when they are creating!                At the ICAF we always remembered her for her foresight at the age               of 8 about the first woman president in The White House.
