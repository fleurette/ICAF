You are standing on the edge of a cliff. You can hear the wind whistling         in your ears and can see trees swaying around you. You look straight         down. It is a steep, even deadly drop; your heart rate speeds up, your         breath becomes shallow, your mouth is suddenly dry. You feel you may         fall at any moment and as if by instinct reach out to grasp at something,         anything, to steady yourself. Your friend screams, you yank off the virtual         reality headset. Both of you look amazed.          Virtual reality, commonly known as VR, immerses one into a virtual world using a headset placed over the eyes         - similar to oversized glasses. The person in the new world becomes removed from his or her real environment,         which is now blocked out, becoming present in the new one. The illusion is strong, and emotions and reactions         often arise as they would in real life. The effect is strong because VR is 360 degrees and often allows for a         great deal of interactivity. While you have the headset on, you can look around and see an environment around         you that was not there before. There can be trees with leaves falling all around you, you can bend down and         see a worm crawling through an apple. Depending on the creator of the world you are observing, there can be         great detail in the smallest things.

Though many problems beset our nation and the world today, a sheer lack of creativity or empathy is too often          their root cause. Creativity cultivates ideation, discovery and invention, while empathy grows compromise,          consensus and collaborative innovation.           The International Child Art Foundation fosters schoolchildren’s creativity and develops empathy through the          arts—children’s universal language.

Currently, students around the world are participating in the school-based 6th Arts Olympiad—a free program          that fosters their creative development. In July 2019, they will convene on The National Mall at their 6th World          Children’s Festival to develop mutual empathy.          Your support will help the ICAF democratize creativity and develop empathy universally as building blocks for          global prosperity and world peace.
