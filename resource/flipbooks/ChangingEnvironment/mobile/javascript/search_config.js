In the literary sense, an epic tells               JUL-SEP 2021                the story of a brave hero in a vast setting who has amazing                            VOL. 21                adventures and who experiences extreme conditions. Your                              ISSUE 03                epic journey most probably contains these same elements.

This issue of ChildArt focuses                on the environment. At this moment, the earth needs all its                travelers to open their hearts and minds to participating in                protecting the resources that sustain all life. As we increase                our awareness of how others experience the world we find                empathy, empathy for our fellow travelers both now and in the                future, and empathy for Mother Earth. This issue of ChildArt                will offer a window into the myriad ways you can be part of                the heroism that will protect our planet. You’ll find advice from                other young people; creative ideas for solving problems using                art, technology, or a great idea; poetry that reminds you of                your presence in this world; and inspiration for how what you                know and what you love can contribute to the cause. Along                with the many ways to help, there are many reasons to help.

She remembers spending time in the quiet                                                      water, under the surface, exploring the coral reefs and looking at the fishes,                                                      wondering if they noticed her. As a child, she didn’t know she would dedicate a                                                      portion of her adult life to protecting the home of these fascinating underwater                                                      friends.                                                       When she was young, her father, Keith Campbell, began receiving “Save the                                                      Bay” bumper stickers in the mail. A lover of bays and oceans, he sent support.                                                      But the bumper stickers kept coming. Samantha remembers, “He kept getting                                                      these stickers and wondering, ‘Well, haven’t they saved it yet? I’ve been getting                                                      these stickers for  20 years.’” So Keith picked up the phone and called the                                                      organization that was sending him the stickers and asked to know more. He                                                      researched his local area, the Chesapeake Bay region, and realized he could                                                      help. In 1998 he founded The Keith Campbell Foundation for the Environment,                                                      a family foundation dedicated to improving the condition of the bays.

While these two bays are almost 3,000 miles apart, they have much in common.                                                      Both bays are estuaries, which are the meeting point between rivers and oceans.                                                      Estuaries are an important home for many animals and plants because of their                                                      unique mix of seawater and freshwater. They are often called the nurseries of                                                      the sea since so many fish, birds, bugs, and other animals have their first home                                                      in these waters.                                                       Pollution,  invasive  species,  and  climate  change  all  make  it  difficult  to  keep                                                      these homes healthy. “We focus most of our attention on what happens on land                                                      because what happens on land runs into the waterways, then down it goes to                                                      the estuaries, and then out into the ocean.” The foundation considers how all                                                      types of pollution impact these ecosystems.                                                      Some pollution, like trash, is easy to see, but there are other stressors in the                                                      water that need to be considered. One example is bioinvasion, which occurs                                                      when a non-native species is brought into a new ecosystem. Since that species                                                      was not originally a part of that community, it can sometimes be too competitive,                                                      negatively  impacting the health of other animals  or plants that were already                                                      living there. Samantha explains that this is a concern for both bays. Many of                                                      these invasive species are brought in through ballast water. “Ships take in water                                                      to balance out their cargo as part of the engineering of the ship. They take water                                                      into the hull and then they let it out when they need to. . . . So, creatures that                                                      came from another part of the ocean are released with the ballast water and                                                      these critters go into a totally new area.” For almost a decade, there have been                                                      stricter laws and regulations governing where ballast water must be emptied to                                                      protect the bays.  a foundation                                        Many factors impact an estuary’s health, and sometimes it can feel overwhelming                                                       and difficult to find a good place to start. The Keith Campbell Foundation for                                                      the Environment reminds us that we can start small and have a big impact. “If  helping life flourish                               everybody did that, those small actions, we would have a lot of involved people.”                                                       If  you  want  to  make  a  difference,  take  a  lesson  from  the  Campbells.  Keith                                                      Campbell created the foundation because he knew he had talents that could help                                                      make the bays healthier and safer, and Samantha helped expand their mission to                                                      care for bays on both sides of the United States. Their first step was to find their  WITH  SAMANTHA  CAMPBELL                            passion and use their talents to make an impact. Samantha reminds us that we,                                                      too, can make a difference by finding our own passion, whether that be protecting                                                      the animals or raising awareness through art. “You definitely have something to                                                      contribute.

The Hoosier Environmental Council (HEC) works to make                                                            that happen.

Dr. Indra Frank is the Director of Environmental Health and Water Policy                                                            for HEC. She recently talked with ChildArt about the close connection  DR .  INDRA  FRANK  ON  ENVIR ONMENT  AND  HEAL TH        between environmental health and human health.                                                             Dr. Frank grew up near a forested area in a small town. Playing outside                                                            often meant clambering around on rocks in the woodland. Camping and                                                            backpacking helped her form a connection with the natural world early in                                                            life. Backpacking, carrying all she needed for survival, she learned that                                                            so much of the “stuff” we think is necessary really isn’t. Her love for the                                                            outdoors and her education helped her understand what is necessary–a                                                            healthy and sustainable environment.                                                            Dr. Frank attended The Johns Hopkins  University School of Medicine                                                            and became a pathologist. Working as a pathologist, she recognized a                                                            connection between disease and the environment. She was convinced that                                                            “we can’t be healthy as people unless we have a healthy environment.”                                                            Consequently, Dr. Frank added a master’s in environmental health to her                                                            education and has been practicing environmental health ever since. She                                                            joined the HEC in 2014.                                                             The HEC works to improve the lives of Indiana residents by improving the                                                            environment. They advocate for clean air, clean water, and clean energy.                                                            In 2019 they merged with a group called Improving Kids’ Environment                                                            (IKE). IKE works on environmental issues that impact children’s health.                                                            One such threat is lead poisoning, which can affect mental and physical                                                            development in children. Children can be exposed to lead through old                                                            paint, but also through the air and soil. So, for example, the HEC works                                                            to keep factories with high lead emissions out of Indiana. The HEC wants                                                            kids to have clean and healthy air to breathe.                                                             The HEC also works on initiatives to safeguard water resources.
