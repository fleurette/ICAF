            known across the world for his efforts to make an impact. In   by the funding as by the project itself, Ghaamid began to ask

            people  with empathy, tenacity,  passion, and an insatiable   United Nations Environment Programme?” and he began to
            drive to seek solutions that will build a sustainable future and   learn. What he learned inspired him to want to know more
