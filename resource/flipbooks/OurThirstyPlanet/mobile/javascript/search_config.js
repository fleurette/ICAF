But        where water is scarce, conflicts can arise as people        fight over this vital resource.                                                                                                                      9          Children and adults at the festival designed and        painted the barrels with themes that revolved        around water, gardens, and peace. The first barrel,                                                           April–June 2016| icaf.org        painted blue, has the theme Drops of Peace.        Participants drew different-sized rain drops on        the barrel and children and adults used acrylic        paints to create peaceful images inside those        drops.

We must invest in youth                                                           today. Adults should mentor children and try to inspire young                                                           people with what they know. I always say, ‘if you want to                                                           protect the environment today, talk to our generation [adults],                                                           but if you want to protect it in the future, you’ve got to get                                                           kids involved.’ That is the goal that I have been working                                                           toward my whole life.                                                            I grew up around the Great Lakes in Detroit, Michigan. The                                                           lakes are part of the ocean in that all water is connected                                                           through rivers, streams, and many other ways. Water has                                                           always played an important part of my life. When I’m in                                                           water, I feel revitalized. Water gives us life, and it is amazing                                                           how much water influences our individual lives.                                                            Jacques Cousteau, the great French explorer, inspired me and                                                           my generation to care about the ocean. He went out and made                                                           discoveries and showed that the ocean wasn’t a dark and scary                                                           place. It was a wondrous place full of animals, a place of light                                                           and color.                                                             I know strongly that art can play an important role in                                                           conservation—not just in the ocean but in the entire planet.                                                           My art has a conservation message. It is subliminal, but                                                           powerful. I decided to start Wyland Foundation to create art                                                           and science programs to engage young people in what they","can do to protect the environment. It is so powerful to        watch some of these kids go on to be great scientists        and great biologists; they’re having their own effect on        the planet. One of the greatest rewards is watching kids        be inspired by their own creativity. The sad thing is that        art and music education are being taken out of schools,        and we need to fight to keep art education in America in        every school and every level. It may be art that comes        up with a new idea. Look at how important art was for        me. Without it, I wouldn’t be doing what I am doing.         As an artist, I learn everything I can in the world        and I share it with kids in a creative way through art        and science. I try to inspire kids to become youth        ambassadors for the planet. In the past 30 years, I’ve met        with children in all 50 states and many countries around        the world. Kids these days are smart, and they know        what’s going on. If they see someone who really cares        about them and encourages them to share their art, they        really begin to shine. Art is such a powerful medium,        especially in the hearts and minds of kids.         Art changes lives        The simple fact is, this is the greatest time in history to        be an artist. Everybody is interested in art, and the whole        world can see it through social media and the Internet.        It’s the greatest time in history to be alive because we can        make a difference. Dr. Sylvia Earle (the world-renowned   that the next generation could usher in an environmental        oceanographer) has said ‘Our actions toward the ocean in   renaissance of sea change. It all begins with you; it begins        the next 10 years will define the next 10,000.’ This means   with each of us. You don’t have to do everything. If you do                                                              little things to protect water and try to keep plastics out of                                                              the environment, it will make a huge difference. Making a                                                              difference empowers people.                                                               Science and art are absolutely connected. In nature, art                                                              and science sometimes go off in different directions, but                                                              they always connect and return to each other in full circle.                                                              We see art everywhere. I have relied on science my whole                                                              life as part of my art, and science has to rely on art too,                                                              because art can visually communicate science. Great                                                              scientists are really artists, and they understand this.                                                                                                                      11                                                              Art should be part of every child’s life. If you’re a kid,                                                              just know that I support you. If you’re an artist, or if you                                                              have a dream to be an artist, don’t ever let go of that. If                                                              you’re not the greatest artist that’s okay, you can still use                                                              art in your life.

He   12                                                          spoke with ChildArt about his bestselling                                                          book Water: The Epic Struggle for Wealth,     ChildArt Magazine                                    Power, and Civilization.                                                           Steven Solomon did a lot of research in preparation for his book. He                                                          found water’s physical properties surprising and its prevalence in our                                                          lives immense. While water makes up roughly 70% of the Earth’s                                                          surface, it also makes up 70% of our bodies.                                                          It is a simple molecule, H2O, and it does many unique things. Water                                                          is present in all three physical forms: liquid, solid, and gas. It defies                                                          gravity by moving up the roots of trees to reach leaves. Water can be                                                          called a “transformative” molecule because it changes many things                                                          on earth and makes life on our planet possible. In addition, water is a                                                          self-renewing resource.

Water is                                                          always in motion, always replenishing and reviving the earth as part                                                          of the water cycle.                                                            Solomon has researched how cities and cars along river banks add                                                          pollutants into the water.

Solomon                                          Every part of the world has water problems. For example, 1 billion                                                           people in the world do not have access to clean drinking water, and                                                          2.5 billion people lack adequate sanitation.                                                             hours each day trying to collect enough water to survive. Solomon         ECONOMICS  \& POLITICS OF WATER WATER             In some parts of the world, water is so scarce that people must spend                                                          explained that he and his family traveled to Kenya to help lay water                                                          pipes for a village. In the village, women and children had to walk                                                          four hours every day to fetch water for their families. Sometimes                                                          each person would carry almost three gallons (about 24 lbs) of water.                                                          When the water was turned on and came through the pipes, people                                                          were overjoyed that they now had clean water directly in their village                                                          and that the children could go to school instead of fetching water                                                          each day.

Every system in the human body                                          depends upon water to function properly.

Also,                                   because plain water has no calories, drinking it helps prevent                                obesity, particularly when water takes the place of sugar-sweetened                                     beverages such as sodas, sports drinks, and juice drinks.

When the survey was conducted, no laws required California schools to                           make free drinking water available to students during meal time. Students who                           wanted to drink water with their meals had to buy bottled water from a vending                         machine or bring water from home. After supporters promoted legislation to provide                          free, fresh drinking water in schools, a California law giving the right to “water in                                              schools” took effect in July 2011.                             But lack of access to free, fresh drinking water in schools was not a problem             25                            unique to California. The problem was prevalent throughout the United States,                           and the issue drew attention in Washington, D.C. Ultimately, the U.S. Congress                            passed legislation promoting water in schools as part of the Healthy, Hunger-                             Free Kids Act, which President Barack Obama signed in December 2010.                              The law took effect at the beginning of the 2011-12 school year in all US                              schools that serve meals as part of the National School Lunch Program.

The ex-       periment was a real eye opener.        I began by consulting with Dr. Stephen Olmore, a geologist, to       better understand the concept of soil profiles and underground       geological structures. Based on what I learned from Dr. Ol-       more, I decided to build three tubes each one representing a       different soil profile. The purpose was to run water samples       through each of the three tubes, extract samples and analyze       what change, if any, could be detected after the water perco-       lated down the different layers of material.        The idea seemed simple enough, but I had to devise a way to     For centuries, the refreshing water fountains       extract samples at different points in each tube. The solution   were the main source of drinking water for       was to separate the different layers with a thick cotton pad at-  many towns.       tached to a small wick on the side of the tube. As the water       soaked the cotton pad, some of it passed to the wick and I was       able to collect my sample.        By now I knew that the chemical changes in the water were       extremely complex and I was not going to be able to measure       all of them, so I concentrated on the acidity level of the water.       Since I was using pH balanced bottled water, it was easy to       conclude than any change in acidity was attributable to the in-       teraction with the soil.        CONCLUSION       After I conducted my experiment I came to realize that once       the rainwater seeps into the ground it undergoes a lot of chemi-       cal changes, and when we add pollutants to the equation, the    Many  coastal communities try to educate the       consequences can be extremely harmful. When we consider         public about the water that goes down the drain.       that the freshwater reserves of our planet are dwindling, and       the water on our planet is basically the same since the time of       the dinosaurs, you may think that future generations will not be       very happy with the pollution we add to the water. Whenever       we use chemical substances of any kind, let’s do it responsibly.       Read the labels for recommendations on proper handling and       disposal and let’s remember that when it comes to groundwater       “out of sight” doesn’t mean “out of mind.”                                                                                                                      27       Interested in learning more about what happens when pollut-       ants  mix with rainwater?
