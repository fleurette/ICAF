I am happiest when my hands are in a bucket of plaster,                                             creating some art form in a creative state. My other joy, is waking up in the morning with all                                             the things I love around me. This includes horses, my wife and my dogs, cats, chickens and                                             peacocks — although I am never very happy when my horses bang on the front door of my                                             dome at the wee hours of the morning demanding their breakfast treats.                                              I do find it difficult to understand why everybody has to walk around with their cell phones                                             out all the time, not really being where they are, but in some kind of virtual space talking                                             to someone else. I walk the streets and see people who I thought were off their rocker                                             because they were talking to themselves, but it turns out they have an ear piece phone.                                             I think it is a bit of a shame that there is less physical communication between people                                             actually talking to each other face to face since the invention of texting. As yet, I have                                             managed to enjoy my life without a cell phone, although I am planning on getting one                                             soon, even us old folks have to try and keep up with modern technology eventually.                                              I think there is something important and poetic about being directly connected to your                                             work, being able to put a lot of effort into something and then seeing its results. It really                                             gives you a sense of accomplishment and joy. I have spent my whole life making scagliola,                                             an artificial marble made from pigmented plaster. With scagliola, you start with dry plaster.                                             Then you mix in rich, dry pigments in various amounts and mixes to get different colors                                             and shades. Plaster of Paris normally sets very quickly, so you slow the time it takes to      www.themagicofscagliola.com            harden by mixing a glue with the water. You mix this glue water with the pigmented dry                                             plaster mixes and watch the color immediately bloom. What you are left with then, are                                                                        funny piles of colored dough-like loaves. Now the magic      The dome and the workshop at Beaver Palace Studios                of scagliola can begin. This is where you get creative. You                                                                        take these blobs and cut and mix them in strange and                                                                        mysterious ways, with other loaves and dry mixes as well.                                                                        You cut and fold and throw and mix – anything that you                                                                        think might produce an interesting design.

I have worked for five royal families all over the globe. I got to      see the world thanks to working with my hands, and I have managed to meet      some wonderful people along the way.       Like many trades of the hand, scagliola had faded into obscurity with modern      advances in technology and culture. It is a pity that so many wonderful crafts      and trades are being forgotten. It seems crazy to me that it is cheaper to buy a      new washing machine, refrigerator, printer, or any appliance than it is to fix the      original. I believe that old trades which require working with your hands and mind      are making a comeback. I think I am playing a small part in bringing scagliola      back into the designs and architecture of our culture. I now live quietly in my      dome with my animals and wife and spend most of my time writing books and      keeping scagliola alive when I am not doing many projects across my property in      upstate New York.

Paint was expensive      then, hand made by grinding dry pigment with a binder — usually      linseed oil – which would dry to a strong coating protecting the      surface and providing color.

But it turned out that my beat-up, run-      down old house would teach me many lessons—including a host of manual skills and the value of preserving historic architecture.       As I labored in the plaster dust, leaky piping, and sagging floors of the old wreck, I gradually became aware that beneath the dirt and      broken woodwork were the bones of what had once been a handsome home. And I literally felt the house was talking to me . . . asking me      to treat it kindly and restore it to the beauty it once possessed.       Restoring the house to its former glory is a monumental task because the work the house needs is painstaking and labor-intensive. This      meant I had to do all the work because hiring other professionals would be too expensive since I was drawing the modest salary of a      McGaw-Hill editor.       Paint stripping, woodwork refinishing, plaster repair, and window restoration were just a few of the skills I had to learn. But the craft that      gave me the greatest pleasure and satisfaction was learning how to do decorative stenciling. I discovered that my brownstone had been      built during the late Victorian era when stenciled decoration of walls and ceilings had been fashionable. Since do-it-yourself stenciling      requires only a few dollars of paint and materials, my house was going to be decorated with Victorian stencils.       The craft of stenciling requires several skills: (a) Pattern selection; (b) Creating the stencil sheet you’ll use in the work; (c) Laying out how      to neatly fit the pattern to your wall or ceiling; and (d) Actually applying the paint. Some of the do-it-yourself manuals and how-to videos on      YouTube make stenciling sound like a difficult skill that requires specialized brushes and exotic paints. Not so! I stenciled my entire house      using regular household paints and normal paint brushes. YouTube videos, however, will show you a variety of techniques, so you pick up      useful tips and gain enough confidence to experiment on your own.       For pattern selection, you can either purchase commercially available stencils or make your own. The advantage of making your stencils      (like I did) is that you have complete freedom to create something entirely your own. In my case, I started by consulting readily available      pattern books from the period; I found Dover Publications to be an excellent inexpensive source for authentic designs. Once you get a little      experience, you’ll find the world is filled with patterns and motifs you can adapt to stencil patterns. Once you select a pattern, it has to be      sized to the scale you’ll need for your surface. Today’s digital photo-manipulation systems make this pretty easy.       After you have the pattern at correct size, next step is to make the working stencil sheet. I found that plain manila file folders work just fine      for stencil material – and traced the pattern onto the cardstock. With the pattern on the manila cardstock, then just carefully cut out the      pattern with an X-Acto knife. Coating the stencil sheet with a couple of coats of shellac or varnish makes it easy to clean excess paint off      your stencil while you work.       It’s a bit tricky to lay out the pattern on the space to be stenciled so that everything fits evenly at the ends and sides. Do a trial run with      some light pencil marks and you’ll soon get the hang of it. If you’re laying out a border on all four sides of a rectangular space, you face the              7  ChildArt  |  January - March 2018","Hand-applied stenciling in the               author’s dining room produces the                 same appearance the house had                                 when it was built       problem of how to manage the turn at the corners      neatly. Sometimes people make a special “turning      block” stencil element to insert at each corner. If you      study how border corners are handled on geometric      carpets, you’ll pick up ideas on how to manage the      turns gracefully.       Before applying paint to your final surface, practice      your technique on a scrap piece of sheetrock or      board. You must learn to avoid causing smudges      by having excess paint leak through the edges of      your pattern. Smudges are eliminated by frequently      wiping your stencil clean and carefully limiting the      amount of paint on your brush. Working with just a      small amount of paint on the brush is completely      different than the technique you use to paint a wall.      That’s why some initial practice is needed.       Begin your practice by dipping about a half-inch      of your brush into the can of paint you’ve selected.      Then start swishing the brush onto a pad of folded      newspaper until about 75% of the paint is removed. The brush should appear almost dry at this point. Then apply the almost-dry      brush to the stencil in a swirling motion. Because there is so little paint on the brush, you won’t get “complete coverage” of paint      onto your surface. But that’s OK; a stenciled image should be almost translucent with perhaps tiny skips here and there. After about      30 minutes of practice you should get the hang of it and be ready to start working on the surface to be decorated.       Before starting the real work, be sure to wipe any extraneous paint off the stencil. Working with a clean stencil at all times is the      secret to avoiding unwanted paint smears. Use masking tape to hold the stencil in place, then start to apply paint with a circular      swishing motion with the almost-dry brush as you learned in practice. When you finish printing all the elements in the first      placement of your stencil pattern, just lift the masking tape and move the stencil sheet along to the next section.       In this way, I was able to decorate my house in authentic Victorian patterns. But the joy of stenciling was only one of many things      I learned from the 1883 brownstone. The house educated me on how to look at architecture . . . how to see the beautiful details                                                               in historic buildings. My brownstone also taught me that      This Greek Wave stencil design from a Dover              old buildings are precious gifts handed down to us by                                                               previous generations—and that it’s our duty to preserve      Publications book was the starting point for a stencil                                                               these architectural treasures to enrich the lives of those      used in the author’s 1883 brownstone                                                               who follow. An additional gift to me was that my interest in                                                               historic architecture led me to start The Old-House Journal                                                               – a publication that passed along restoration and renovation                                                               secrets to new old-house owners.

My work involves the      conservation and restoration of historic ornamental plaster elements as well as designing, producing and installing new ornamentation.      What really interests me are Eighteenth through Twentieth Century decorative enrichments focusing on ceiling medallions, cornices, and      ornamental metals. For more than 40 years, I have been involved in restorations at many historic houses and significant projects. These      include, the Diplomatic Reception rooms at the U.S. Department of State, projects at the White House, and ornamental plasterwork in the      American Wing period rooms at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.       After my schooling, I rented a studio from an ornamental plasterer and became interested in one of his major projects to restore a church      in South Philadelphia that had burned. My job was as a model maker for the project. That meant putting together doors, windows, columns,      capitals, cornices, etc. to match the originals. One day while I was working, Edward Jones, the architect for the White House during      the early 1970s, walked in. He looked at what I was doing and said: “That’s it, you’re on my team.” My first project for him was a ceiling      medallion in the Blue Room at the White House.       I was introduced to the Merchants House because of Jones and his involvement as the curator of the American Wing at the Metropolitan      Museum of Art. Edward Jones and I would walk through Greenwich Village in lower Manhattan after dinner on summer nights. We      looked through parlor floor windows of Greek Revival houses and studied the ornamental plasterwork. None was more beautiful than the      Merchants House.       New York City is my most favorite town. My first visit was to the New York World’s Fair in 1939 with my parents, although I don’t remember      that. I do remember seeing the French ocean liner “The Normandie” on its side in dock on the Hudson River in 1942. Anyway, the chance      to work on the Merchants House, a wonderful Greek Revival house with significant plaster interiors, thrilled me.        The designer/architects of the Merchants House were unique. That was made clear by studying other ornamental plasterwork in lower      Manhattan. It revealed that there was very little which compares to the 1832 style of the Merchants House.       The Merchant’s House has been described as “transitional” to the extent that its unrestrained Federal woodwork coexists handsomely with      its robust Greek Revival plaster ornamentation. Indeed, the matching ceiling medallions in the double parlors are unquestionably the finest      designs to survive into the late Twentieth Century and, in my the opinion, they are superior to any composed during the American classical      revival.                                                                David Flaharty attended the Rhode Island School of                                                                Design and Cranbrook Academy of Art          11  ChildArt  |  January - March 2018","David Flagherty as a                                                                           young child                                Figure 1: Plate 21            Builder-architects of typical lower Manhattan row houses generally      specified flat plaster ceilings using three-coats of plaster on sawn      wooden lath. Decorations / enrichments might have been bought      from a local plaster shop. These designs often copied from period      stylebooks, such as Minard Lafever’s “The Beauties of Modern      Architecture of 1835” (Fig 1).       The Merchant’s House medallions, however, had greater detail and      craftsmanship with recessed alternating acanthus foliate center      clusters. To achieve this dramatic result, framing and lathing of the      central ceiling joists was necessarily more elaborate than simply      running joists level from party wall to party wall. Like many early      houses in New York City, the Merchant’s House has been subject                                                                Ceiling medallian in author’s dining room      to masonry settling, water intrusion and heavy vehicular traffic—all      factors which cause plaster ceilings to fail. This was particularly true      for the center of a ceiling with oversized ornamentation. Luckily for      the Merchant’s House, the unusually substantial framing allowed      these medallions to withstand the forces of gravity regardless of the      increased weight.                                                                Ornament created based on Plate 21      After the flat plastering was complete, reeded mouldings were      turned on the ceilings. This was done using a mixture of gypsum      and lime troweled ahead of revolving sheet metal template blade      nailed to stocks and slippers. Off-site cast plaster enrichments,      such as the illustrated center cluster, guilloche/rosette and      surround acanthus foliage (see Fig. 2), were then set within and      around the runs using a plaster adhesive.       Students of Greek Revival plaster medallions will no doubt be      pleased to learn that this medallion form has never been designed      and executed more brilliantly than in the double parlors of the      Merchant’s House. As an avid voyeur, peering through windows of      Greenwich Village townhouses, Edward Jones led me on tours of      observing centerpieces composed with varying degrees of success,      but none compared to those at the Old Merchant’s House. There      can be no question that the unidentified craft genius that fabricated      this American classical revival plasterwork accomplished an      unusually sublime performance.                                                                        icaf.org  12","Looking Back                                                                              and Moving                                                                               Forward:                                                                               Structural                                                                              Engineering for                                                                              Historic                                                                              Architecture                                                                               ~ John Matteo                                                                                   www.1200ae.com                                                                              I have enjoyed drawing from a very young age.

Where numbers and words may fall short, a drawing can often complete the picture in our minds     eye and be accessible to a broad group.      One of the ways I relate to my profession as a structural engineer along with my curiosity to understand the past, sometimes reminds me     of driving a car. We use the rearview mirror to see where we’ve been but never lose sight of where we’re going. This was particularly true     when I stepped into the Peabody Library in Baltimore, MD, where the visual splendor of the interior tells us immediately that this is a great     work of architecture from the past – a “Cathedral of Books.” However, envisioning this treasured resource for future generations would     require acts of empathy, innovation and imagination, from a broad team of specialists.      The challenges being faced included a failing rooftop skylight, significant thermal inefficiency, and limited access within the attic space     above the library. As a structural engineer, my challenge waited above the glass ceiling, or lay light, where wrought iron trusses from 1878     span across the atrium. (P-Trusses) The iron trusses, a combination of I-shaped beams and struts with diagonalized tie rods, were found     to be very efficiently designed for the requirements and standards of the late 19th century, but at risk of failure when adding heavier,     thermally-efficient skylight panels as well as new catwalks to get access over the lay light. In addition, our understanding of rooftop snow     loading, with drift and unbalanced loads, is more advanced than when this building was designed, so the original structure had some     significant weaknesses when evaluated based upon current standards.     Reinforcing the trusses with new steel components was the answer,                                                                  Founding Principal at 1200 Architectural Engineers,     but how to do it, both from the design approach as well as from the                                                                  John Matteo has a Masters in Civil Engineering from     actual construction, remained a challenge.

I like to                                        think of it as being analogous to a group of people speaking different languages communicating                                        about the built environment. As engineers, one of our main “languages” we use to understand the                                        physical world is mathematics. As a language, mathematics offers a framework of consistency                                        and rigor that helps us understand the physical behavior of a structure, and then make our best                                        efforts to predict it’s future when changes are proposed. With calculations in hand, we must                                        then find a way to communicate our findings to the group. Two other forms of language are                                        then required – speech and graphics. We talk about and describe our findings with words and                                        drawings.                                         Introducing strengthening components within the complex geometries of the Peabody Library                                        roof trusses required a lot of drawing, both to clarify the design concept and then to prove that it                                        could work within that intricate context. (P-Details)                                         Once a direction is agreed upon, we must now communicate to another group of people – the                                        builders. Here again, we still find that an illustrative graphic will help bring the expanded team                                        together, but an additional demand for precise dimensions and sequence of construction quickly                                        moves to the forefront. The people fabricating the steel need to know exactly what sizes and                                        thicknesses are needed, while the people installing the pieces need to know how they will be                                        lifted into place and that they will fit.

Are you at ease,      comforted? Is there anything in your view, the proportions of a room      a door frame, an alcove, which spark a sense of aesthetic pleasure?      While there is room for all kinds of making, it is worth noting how      objects and spaces make us feel. A machine-tooled item feels      different from something handmade. Even something handmade      from a different culture feels different than something handmade      locally. Spaces and objects can help us feel a sense of pride,      comfort or even awe. These are the spaces usually touched by      hand and imbued with thoughtful care.

I got my first project mural painting when I was about eleven.

As a teenager I travelled to Europe with my art history class, and I saw      there so many very old churches and palaces where the art and the architecture were really integrated, working so beautifully together,      with frescoed murals and decorative ornament on the ceilings, and I found this so inspiring. Many of the murals painted in the 16th-18th      centuries were kind of dramatic and theatrical, and not surprisingly, painted by artists who also worked in theaters.       When I went to university I studied architecture and art, and through this I learned how to design and paint site-specific artwork like I      had seen in my travels. Eventually all of these interests lead me to painting murals and ornament for people’s homes, and in hotels and      restaurants, and to restoring the painted ornament in beautiful old buildings.       I am the kind of person who rearranges the furniture in my house all the time, and I am always looking for new things to try. I love fabric,      and books, and costumes, and history. I am a little obsessed with things like pigment and gold leaf and specialized tools and brushes, to the      point where my art studio looks a bit like a mad scientist’s laboratory.       I still travel a lot, and I have painter friends in many different countries, who also restore palaces and churches and decorate grand houses.      Thanks to the internet we can keep in touch easily and even collaborate. These days I am known mostly for designing new decoration, but      all of my work is still inspired by the history of my art, and by all of the incredible artists who decorated architecture in the centuries before      me.

They                                                                were offering six different courses of study, fine carpentry, timber                                                                framing, plaster work, masonry, stone carving and blacksmithing.

When I arrived, I saw Simeon                                                                demonstrating stone carving, and everything just clicked for me.

To this day                                                                I’m not sure I ever actually made it to the blacksmithing booth.                                                                 In August of 2016, I was working as part of a team of carvers, for                                    Mimi Moore working on                                                                Twin City Tile and Marble, on the Minnesota State Capital building                                    the Minnesota State Capital                                                                that was undergoing a complete historic restoration job.                                    building                                                                One of the projects I worked on was the complete removal and                                                                replacement of a festoon or swag detail that had a fault/crack                                                                running from the top down to the bottom of the stone. Because of                                                                this crack the stone was structurally unsound and needed to be                                                                replaced.                                                                 Before the piece was removed, I documented and drew up all                                                                aspects of the stone in order to properly duplicate it later on. The                                                                first step was to work up full scale drawings so that I could make                                                                templates to use when I carved the new piece. When the new stone                                                                was delivered to the construction site it measured 4’-4” wide, 3’                                                                high and 1’-2” deep. I had made a general size template that the                                                                sawyers were able to use to cut the stone down to a rough size.                                                                Then it was handed over to me so I could begin laying out the                                                                various section and face templates I made from the drawing. This                                                                is when I started the physical work of carving. Now the fun could                                                                really begin.

The first step is                                                                to rough out the general shape of all the different elements in the                                                                piece. This allowed me to drastically reduce the weight of the stone.                                                                Then, the stone was hoisted up the scaffold and placed near an                                                                existing festoon that had similar detail as the one being replaced.

Once the stone was around 75% carved it was ready to be installed.      Sometimes, all of the carving is done after the piece is installed      but because the stone was so large we wanted to get as much      weight off as we could before it was installed. That made it so that      the scaffold could support the weight safely and make it easier to      install.       When working on a restoration job it is important to do the final part      of the carving after the stone is installed. This way the new stone      details will match the historic stone surrounding it more accurately.       Now Simeon stated that stone carving is “one day at a time” kind of   Roughing out the shape of the new piece      work and that refers to the mindset we should have when carving,      because if you rush the carving, you will ruin the carving, there is no      easy fix when it comes to stone. So, it is best to just relax and enjoy      the work because that will give you the best result. As for deadlines      though, the reality is that you usually have to give the boss a      timeline for your work. When I complete a piece inside my timeline I      feel a huge sense of accomplishment outside of the enjoyment I get      from carving the stone. I have to say that without Simeon I would      not have found this sense of accomplishment and love for my work.      I count myself among the few very lucky people who love what they      do and this is due to my teachers.

The basic attitude that my parents taught us was that life is      River and to many Caribbean Islands. Seven years after our first   meant to be lived, and each day is to be experienced. This can be      boat trip, my dad got the boat bug again and built another, larger   something as simple as visiting a local zoo, a museum, speaking      sailboat. This time I was 11 years old and my parents and their five   with an older person about their life experiences, or taking a trip to      energetic teenage children spent another amazing year traveling   another city or another country. But the challenge is to live a life not      oceans and exploring new islands. I have fond and wonderful   based on other people’s expectations of the “norm”, but to discover      memories of discovering deserted islands, snorkeling reefs filled   your dream, and not be afraid to live it.      with vibrant sea life, and meeting fascinating people living their own      adventurous boater’s dream.       Mary May, a woodcarver who lives in Charleston, South Carolina, says: To begin with a blank piece of wood, to      imagine the steps and process of how to achieve the design, to begin to slowly chip away and shape the wood, and      to watch the shape evolve into a beautiful creation. What can be more satisfying than to create something beautiful      with your hands? I remember in the movie “Chariots of Fire” when Eric Liddell ran he said “...when I run, I feel God’s      pleasure.” That is how I feel when I carve.                                                                                                            icaf.org  26","How I Became Involved in                      Historic Preservation           ~ Dave Mertz                            dmertz@belmontcollege.edu                           Professor David R. Mertz continues to serve as the                          director of the Building Preservation/Restoration                          Program at Belmont College in St. Clairsville,                          Ohio—a post he has held since the program’s                          inception in 1989.      I remember when I was younger, someone telling me that I should pursue a career      that I have a passion for so that work wouldn’t feel like work...it would be fun. I always      remembered that. While I have many passions in life, I have been lucky enough to      weave together a number of them into what has become my career today.       At the age of eleven, I was cast as Brutus in our elementary school production of Julius Caesar. While I did my best to not get the part      (acting was not cool in the 5th grade at Farmersville Elementary school), my teacher Mrs. Haldeman, saw something I didn’t even see      and to this day I am forever grateful. While I thoroughly enjoyed acting, I didn’t pursue it until I reached my sophomore year of high school      where I became a regular in Freedom High School theatrical productions. Little did I know that the skills I learned acting would someday      be instrumental in my career.       I also loved history and I was good at it in school. In the 7th grade, my class participated in “Craftsmen Along the Monocacy,” where we      dressed up in colonial costumes and performed trades common to the 18th century for visitors of Historic Bethlehem. I learned how to      pit-saw and it made history come alive. My parents helped develop that love of history by taking my sisters and I on day trips to places like      Philadelphia to see the Liberty Bell and Valley Forge to see where Washington’s troops spent the winter during the Revolutionary War.      Finally, I had a knack for art I inherited from my mother. I loved to draw and paint. My dad and grandfather built a house a year as a hobby.      From the time I reached my teens, I was out on the jobsite helping out. I learned how to install insulation, perform trim carpentry, run      electrical wire, etc. I guess it was only natural when it came time to go to college that I chose to pursue a career in architecture at Kansas      State University. With architecture, I could pursue my artistic side. Before I graduated, I was asked to serve as a faculty assistant and was      actually responsible for teaching a design class. From that moment on, I was hooked. I had that “ah-ha” moment when I decided that I      really wanted to be a teacher. It just came so naturally to me from my days in theater.       As fate would have it, I stayed on and pursued my graduate degree in Historic Preservation while I continued to teach as a graduate      assistant. My love of history was fueled by my new love of historic buildings. When I graduated again, I took a job in an architect’s office but      was not happy. I wanted to be in front of a class, I wanted to share my passion.       An opportunity presented itself in 1989, a chance to start a new program in historic preservation at a small technical college in Eastern      Ohio. I convinced the college that they needed to teach people how to fix old historic buildings. Today, 28 years later, I’m still teaching      people how to take care of historic structures and I love every minute of it.       There is no such thing as a typical day in my job. While part of my schedule is rigid and adheres to the start and stop times of the classes I      teach, the rest of my schedule is always changing and is affected by the needs of the students, the college and the community. I will often      spend a couple hours each day outside of class working with individual students on their class projects like building a bracket or running a      plaster medallion. I spend a few hours each week handling the administrative duties of running a college program. I’m in constant contact      with potential students and serve on a variety of committees that help govern the college. In my free time, I’m contacted by all kinds of      people representing a variety of organizations who are looking for advice on how to care for their historic structures.        I often spend a lot of time on the road, walking with clients through their buildings, trying to figure out why their foundation is cracking or      why their plaster is detaching from the ceiling. Sometimes, these structures are in famous buildings like Monticello, Thomas Jefferson’s      home in Virginia, or in the Governor’s Mansion here in Ohio. I like that every day is different and that I have to spend a lot of time problem      solving. I also like that on a daily basis, I get to work with the students in the shops, working with my hands, helping them build their      projects. Helping my students become graduates, finding jobs, and building careers in historic preservation are my proudest moments. I      really do love my job.                                                              http://www.belmontcollege.edu/news-archive/news-2014/          27  ChildArt  |  January - March 2018               belmont-college-professor-receives-national-award/","1          Matching Game                                                                         F                     Match the author with a quote from their article.                                                                 4               You can find the answers on the back cover.
