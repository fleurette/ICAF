     I was only three years old when we set sail, so I don’t remember   a boat. But this same principal can be applied to wherever you are

     Mary May, a woodcarver who lives in Charleston, South Carolina, says: To begin with a blank piece of wood, to
     imagine the steps and process of how to achieve the design, to begin to slowly chip away and shape the wood, and
     to watch the shape evolve into a beautiful creation. What can be more satisfying than to create something beautiful
     with your hands? I remember in the movie “Chariots of Fire” when Eric Liddell ran he said “...when I run, I feel God’s
     pleasure.” That is how I feel when I carve.
