A binder is anything that makes the           pigment become liquid and stick to           the surface you are painting on. Binder           literally ‘binds’ the paint to the surface           (paper, wood, canvas, etc.). There are           many different kinds of paint, each           kind is made using a different binder.              If you want to paint on paper,           for example, many people use           watercolors. Watercolor is pigment           mixed with water. For it to last longer,           artists also mix in some tree sap called           gum arabic. Gum arabic and water are           the binders that make “watercolor”!              If you want to paint on canvas,           we often use oil paints. Oil paint is           pigment mixed with plant and seed           oils. Most often, the oil of flax seed,           which creates oil called linseed oil.              Many other type of paints that           can be made. Artists use a number of           things, and love to experiment with           what is around. Milk, honey, spit, juice,           water, olive oil, butter are all possible           binders to try. The best idea is to mix           just a little bit of pigment with a little           bit of binder each time you want to           paint something. This keeps the paint           fresh, and it allows you to use your      5           dry pigment over and over again for           different projects.

Selling stuff to kids is big business.            Companies spend billions each year            just on the marketing.  And while there            may be controversy about marketing            to kids, particularly the youngest            ones, the fact is that companies who            sell products – whether they’re toys,            shampoo, or school supply items –            can’t afford to ignore you, the            young shoppers.              Grabbing your attention takes            more than the right product. The            packaging is just as important when            you are making a decision about            whether or not to buy the stuff.            Creating packaging that appeals to            young children can be pretty simple            – a smiling Disney character or colors            that mimic a popular kid’s show on the            package can make a product leap            off the shelves.  Creating packaging            that appeals to tweens and teens,            isn’t as simple.

How color perception works and is used by kinetic                                           artist Carlos Cruz-Diez.                   Alicia Mendez Cruz                 Have you wondered if the color green            you see is the same as what everyone            else sees? This question has intrigued            artists for a long time and today’s            neuroscientists have some answers.            They say color is not only dependent            on the eye but a property of the mind,            meaning that when you see something            green, you are not really seeing green            but you are experiencing “greenness”.            Pigments, light, or even an illusion            can make you experience greenness.            Carlos Cruz-Diez, a Venezuelan artist            passionate since childhood about            colors, has dedicated his life to            revealing the changing, unstable, and            ephemeral nature of color.               The color of an object is            determined by the wavelengths            of light that its surface absorbs or            reflects. The reflected wavelengths are            captured by the eye and interpreted            by the brain as different colors.            The eye has three types of little            “photoreceptors”(receptors of light            called cones) that perceive red, green            or blue. All colors are a combination of            these three but perceived in different            proportions. Eyes can only perceive            color when there is sufficient light,            that is why when there is not much            light it is like seeing in “black and            white”. Humans have three cone            types; dogs, have only two (yellow            and blue); some birds, insects, reptiles    Color Aditivo            or fishes, like the mantis shrimps, can     Permutable 1            have up to 16 different color receptive           2011            cones.

Kassia St. Clair               Light from the Sun appears white but it is actually made            up of six basic colors, which we can see in a rainbow: red,            orange, yellow, green, blue and violet. Light is a form of            energy and travels in waves. Each of these colors of light has            a different wavelength. As the light from the Sun reaches            the Earth it collides with particles of the atmosphere.  The            different colors are affected by these collisions. Blue light            has a short wavelength and is scattered more than red and            yellow light, which have longer wavelengths.                  “The ocean is blue because water absorbs             sediments and particles in the water.
