This requires them to know just what conditions in space are like,      because they are very different from those on Earth (much hotter      or colder, a vacuum,  different gravity, radiation,  etc.)  so that      what they create will be able to survive and work properly.       Other  space  careers  include  space  doctor,  space  lawyer  and      space business person. Space doctors exist to make sure that      astronauts stay physically and mentally fit, before, during and      after their space missions. Usually a space doctor has qualified                   Albert Eintstein      as a normal doctor first, and then goes on to do extra training to      specialize in space.       Space lawyers exist to make sure that space law (did you imagine such a      thing  exists?) is respected.  Space  law deals  with many questions. Some      examples are: Who is allowed to put a satellite in a particular orbit? If one      spacecraft damages another, who must pay for the damage? How and when      can someone lay claim to part of the Moon or an asteroid and use it for      themselves?       Space business people look for ways to make money from or using space.      This might be by building satellites or by launching spacecraft on rockets      or it  could  be  by offering  a  service  delivered  from  space,  for example      weather forecasts, navigation information or telephone and television by      satellite. Space business is big business. In 2014, world space business was      more than $250 billion.       But what about space artists? There are not very many of them so far (but                             Yuri Gagarin      you can read articles by some of them in this magazine). Space artists have      a special role. Because art is linked very deeply with the way we humans      create our societies, artists are specially placed to bring together new ideas      from  across  many  fields  and  so  use  their  imaginations  to  stimulate  new      ways of looking at space and new ways of thinking about space and how we      interact with it.       So far, most ‘space art’ has been art about or inspired by space but      created and viewed on Earth. As we start to look deeper, explore                       further and move out into space ourselves,    Chris Welch, PH.D.      our art will do the same, expressing                              NASA’s Fermi Gamma-ray telescope                               even  more  new ideas  and                                relationships  and  stimulating                                  even more discoveries.                                     Imagination  is the fuel.                                    Artists create the ‘engines                                    of imagination’ for our                                    endeavors.

I would like to share  Yves Cousteau, the oceanographer who created the movie “The      with all of you why I became an artist, who influenced me, and  Silent World”. I became interested in the world of nature through      why I create space art. I would also like to introduce my artwork  artists and how they portrayed it.      that was chosen to be exhibited in space.

My father also  elementary school, and saw the Leonids while in high school.      loved to draw, and I can still remember the vehicles and creatures  These were some unforgettable experiences with space. In 1968,      he drew. When I was in third grade in elementary school, my  all I could think about was art and space after seeing the image      mother gave me a daily assignment--to observe nature and draw  of Earth taken by Apollo 8 spacecraft. I got the idea for space      it every day. I believe my parents helped train my perspective of      the world by having me draw. I was so touched by the paintings      and sculptures I saw that I decided to become an artist myself.        The people who inspired me as a young person.      Artists  I  admired  between  my  elementary  and  junior  high      school years were Yokoyama Taikan, the ink painter, European      modern artists such as Monet and Rodin, and Alexander Calder,      the inventor of the mobile, a moving sculpture that moves in      response to air currents.

Even trees and plants communicate with each      other using chemical signals; the bees know exactly where the      roses are; and animals know where other friends or foes may be      waiting. We all SMELL – actively and passively.       Perhaps intelligent lifeforms elsewhere can ”sniff us out”. This      is a far-fetched idea – even our astronomers don’t have sensitive      enough instruments. We can’t see more than fractions of the sky      at once, and we haven’t looked for very long. With telescopes we      read light waves to tell if a star is hot or cold; we know if a planet      is rocky or gaseous, but little else. We know there are complex      organic molecules in interstellar gases, but we can’t tell which      ones they are. If we build more sensitive instruments, we might      decode this information and zoom in on an interesting smelly      place. Maybe then we could discover an alien biosphere….       My whole proposition is science fiction, but it also makes me      feel creative. It makes me appreciate Earth and everything here.      I feel very much at home. If I were to communicate with an      alien, I’d like to talk about where I come from and what makes      it beautiful and quirky. I would want to know the same about      where the aliens were living. Perhaps we could share some ideas      after that, about gravity and physics, things we know how to do,      and whether there are wormholes, and how not to die.

Silica aerogel is the lightest solid material in the      world; NASA uses it as a spacecraft insulator and also in order      to catch stardust.  Aerogels have excellent  thermal  insulation      properties and they are paradigmatic materials for designing our      future homes.       I encountered silica aerogel back in 2001 when I was a Research      Fellow at MIT. For the reason that this ethereal material looks      like our sky, I transferred it to Art and Design. In order to do so,      I had to refresh my memory on Chemistry and Physics and study                                   Photo 1: Bottled Sky,      nanotechnology;  collaborating  with  scientists  from  California                             silica aerogel, glass      and  India.

Every  aerosculpture  has a  blue  and  an  orange  natural  color      because  of scattering  phenomenon.  Let’s take  a  look  at  the      Bottled  Sky  in  Photo  1. The  light  scatters  off  and  offers  this      natural blue color. If now, you put the Bottled Sky between your      eyes and a source of light, then the sky will turn to a transparent      orange. For the same reason, when viewed in direct light, the      SkyFlower in Photo 2 appears blue. But when the light is passing      through the sculpture, then—as we can see its shadow projection      on a sheet of transparent velum in Photo 3—the sculpture offers      a dramatic gold/orange hue.

I had to find another way.

I always knew I would study in the sciences. I loved physics and      biology. The University we selected – the University of Alabama      in Huntsville  – was well  known for its engineering  program.      When it came time to select my major field of study, I worried.      I wanted to study computers. There was just one problem: I had      neither owned nor touched a computer before. But I wanted to      learn everything about it.       My father brought me to my school in America and left two days  Young Navneet  later. I was 16 years old. I had no family or friends in this vast  Young Navneet      land.  I had crossed the oceans like I imagined, and the mountains      and  forests  I  had  painted  were  finally  in  front  of  me. A  girl      studying computer engineering, from a foreign island, younger      than everyone else: I still felt so small. But I kept looking up at      the sky.       It  was  the  first  day  of  my  very  first  programming  class  in      the  computer  lab.  When  the professor asked  us to  start  our      computers, I sat in front of mine, terrified. I had never turned one      on in my life. I watched everyone start theirs effortlessly and I      felt so unintelligent. But I was determined to become an expert.      I studied and studied. A year into my university schooling, my      father lost his job. My country was engulfed in war. My family’s      prospects looked very grim. It became clear that they no longer      could pay for my studies. But because my grades were high, and   “If you aim for the sky, you’ll at least make it to the top of that tree, but if you aim for the top of that tree, you won’t get very far off the ground.”      I showed much promise as a woman in computer engineering, I      won scholarships from the university. I still had to work to pay for      food and living expenses. I wasn’t sure when the school would      stop my scholarship so I took more classes than anyone else to      speed up my education and finish early. I worked at night and on      weekends. I sold hand-drawn portraits and my textbooks      so I could have money to eat. And then, I graduated from      the University, the only girl in my class with a degree      in Computer Engineering, with the highest      honors. I was nineteen years old.       At my  graduation  ceremony, I  was      introduced  to the man who      became my first boss. He offered      me a job working on the software      for the  engines on NASA’s Space      Shuttle that helped carry it out      into  space.  In all  the  times      that I was aiming for the      sky, I never knew that one      day I would make it beyond its      limits.  The  unremarkable  brown      girl from a tiny island became a      rocket scientist. Today, I work on      engineering marvels and complex      machines that really do touch the stars.

Further,  you  don’t  have      to be a professional artist to make art. As long as you put your      genuine effort and spirit into art, you can create art. In this sense,      you are a natural born artist. Your mind is like a mirror. A mirror      which is easily damaged or dirtied, but can be polished anytime.      If you polish your mirror, you can see yourself clearly. And as      long as you strive to create something unique from the bottom of      your heart, you can always be an artist. Art is also like a mirror,      which reflects yourself, and further reflects cosmos.        To be honest, I’m not sure why I’m so curious about cosmos.

Cosmic art,  in                                              2      general, is art from the cosmic point of view. Art, science, and      technology are merged within the vast context of the cosmos.      It is not a specific type of art, but is the idea of creating a new      possibility  beyond  any  field,  via  our  common  language  -  the      cosmos.       Let  me  introduce  some  examples  from  our  art  practice.  For      instance, in fig.2, you can see the colorful spheres floating in the      night sky. This Moons of Naoshima was created on a Japanese      isolated island called Naoshima. These are the imaginary moons      which school children made. The artwork is not only something      special,  created  by the professional artist,  but also a thing      everyone can take part in.       Here’s  another  example:  this  work  entitled  Uy-uni-verse:      Multiverse (fig.3) was created in the Japan Aerospace Exploration      Agency  (JAXA)’s  Tanegashima  Space  Center.  Collaborating      with the artists, designers, an engineer, a mathematician,  an      architect, and local residents, we made it together. In this work,      2      In this article, the term ‘cosmic art’ is used to broaden the idea of      ‘space art’, which refers to outer space in general. Cosmic art and space art      are still not specifically differentiated, and their meanings vary.                                   icaf.org  28","What is the reason for putting a dolphin sculpture/satellite in orbit                              Richard, age 11                                                                around planet earth transmitting dolphin sounds into space?
