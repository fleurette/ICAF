Next Issue: April - June 2016, Our Thirsty Planet","why Music                       Music  is a giant melting pot of different cultures, a         universal language that transcends borders and barriers.         Music is for reading, humming, whistling, and singing. It is         for playing, fiddling, strumming, performing, composing,         thumping, bumping, rapping, dancing, and feeling. More         than a sound, music brings joy to life. It comforts and heals.         In this issue we explore musical expression. Musicians from         all over the world share how music changed their lives. We         investigate the science of music and the correspondence         between music and math. We also explore nature’s song: the         silence of outer space, the chirping of birds, and sounds of         other creatures.          If you play a musical instrument, it increases your sensory         stimulus. Musical training enhances the activity of         important neural systems and stimulates language         development in the brain. Anita Collins of TED-ed says,         “Playing music has been found to increase the volume         and activity in the brain’s corpus callosum (the bridge         between the two hemispheres), allowing messages to get         across the brain faster and through more diverse routes.         This may allow musicians to solve problems more         effectively and creatively, in both academic and social         settings.”          Today, thanks to the technology, music is everywhere.         Music is also used in psychological operations. In the         movie, Back to the Future, Marty uses Van Halen’s          music to scare his dad awake, since his dad had never         heard that sound before. The term “music torture”         describes the subjecting of detainees, for example, at         Guantanamo Bay, with very loud heavy metal music that         never ceases, day or night.          Identity          Music has many different styles of sound, known as genres.         Pop, country, rock, hip-hop, electronic, rap, classical, and         heavy metal are just a few. Think about the types of music         you like. Do you ever wonder why you like the         music that you like? We develop preferences for certain         genres based on our love for what sounds familiar, like a         precious memory. We also develop preferences based on         our love for what sounds intriguingly distinct from anything         heard before. Some ears even develop distaste for certain         genres, but others accept all types of tunes. This is called         music preference. Your age, mood, environment, and         identity can shape your musical preferences.         One’s age can affect musical preference because of          1    ChildArt: Why Music Matters","Matters                       generational shifts in how new music sounds and what is   into something meaningful that we hear in our own heads.         considered popular, which may dictate what is played on the   Actually, there is no sound in your brain; instead, your brain         radio or in restaurants.

Music                                                                 can reduce suffering, and it can bring happiness.         As a universal language, music is fundamental to human life.         It reaches deep and touches our emotions. A song may bring         tears to some eyes, and other songs may ignite the feet to         dance. Music is composed of vibrations of sound waves with         different frequencies, which echo the way we feel emotions.         The oldest surviving example of a complete musical         composition, including musical notations, is the Seikilos         epitaph, a Hellenistic Ionic song:          While you live, shine have no grief at all         life exists only for a short while         and time demands an end.          Music has always been a powerful tool for expression. In         Persian history, the legendary King Jamshid is known as the         inventor of music. In Jewish tradition, Moses’sister Miriam         led the children of Israel in singing a “song of deliverance”         after they crossed the Red Sea. The Gregorian Chant is the         oldest musical portion of the Roman Catholic iturgy. Music         also plays an important role in the religious practice of Sufi         Muslims.

I                                                     worked in restaurants, I was a car detailer, I worked in pizza                                                     shops and sandwich shops, I was a waitress, bartender, and a retail-                                                     er in vintage and new clothing stores.

I am a firm believer that if you want something enough         and you believe that it will come to be, there is a         universal shift that happens and things fall into         alignment. But you have to keep a very positive         outlook and it’s hard to do that if there are things         working against you. Ultimately, you need to get to         that place where you just can’t be deflated and you         believe in yourself so strongly that nobody can tell you         otherwise. Then there is nothing that can stop you.          No matter what happens in the world, we will always         need art and music.

So, what makes a         sound musical?         It turns out that melodic instruments, like the guitar or flute,         make the surrounding air vibrate in a very orderly pattern.           19   ChildArt: Why Music Matters","A semitone is the distance between any two adjacent notes   ues, note duration values, and volumes to numbers  gener-  Music \& Mathematics   on the piano.

For every scale, an incredible variety of         chords can be constructed by using patterns of note         numbers.           It’s important to point out that the semitone-based scales we         are talking about belong to the tradition of what we refer         to as Western music – music that has its origins in Europe.         Other cultures divide the octave differently. For example,         much of Middle Eastern music uses an octave that is divided         into 24 parts.          We’ve learned about the mathematics of notes, how scales         are constructed from notes, and how chords can be con-         structed from scales. There are many other important aspects         of music such as rhythm, meter, harmony, counterpoint,         and song structure that are deeply rooted in mathematics.         It’s also worth mentioning that if you use a software audio         player that has a song  visualization module, the animation         you see is based on mathematical information that reflects         the frequency content and the changing volume in a song.

In         fact, for centuries, mathematical techniques have been used         by famous  composers like Bach and Mozart to help develop         their ideas or establish the structure of their compositions.

It is useful to give ratings a number of points to show their                                                                 value more clearly.

What are good playlist themes that use ratings?            One theme is a playlist by artist.  Another is a playlist by           rating. A playlist by artist emphasizes the artist, using           ratings to build the playlist. A playlist by rating emphasizes           the ratings themselves.            Can other themes be used?            here are actually an unlimited number of possible themes.           For example, you could make a playlist of songs that have           colors in their titles. Finding them all might take some work,           but you could still order them by rating. Theme choice is           limited only by your imagination.           27   ChildArt: Why Music Matters","What is Song Rating?
