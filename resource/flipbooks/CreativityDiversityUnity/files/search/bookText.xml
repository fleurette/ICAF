 To Promote Friendship, Be a Friend



                        with Love





        by ART TEACHER Tracy Cheney and her students
        A     t the Berkeley Hall School in Los Angeles, I had


              never heard of the Art Olympiad until I received
              a call from the ICAF inviting the school to
        participate. When I laughingly mentioned the phone
        call to my students, they jumped on the opportunity
        immediately. I mean, at that very moment they whipped
        out sketch paper! They weren’t daunted by the large size
        of the paintings they’d have to produce in three short
        weeks for the Arts Olympiad. It was a marathon that
        consumed every recess and lunch hour. Six students
        powered through to a finished painting, with others
        cheering them on just like a sports race. I sent the
        paintings by overnight carrier to D.C. just in the nick of
        time, and a group of us attended the WCF.
        Once the school year began again, we made a movie
        about our trip. The students then narrated their high-
        lights of the trip. Here are some impressions in the stu-

        five blind children took the stage with their homemade
        wooden instruments, they played the sweetest, most
        consonant music I had ever heard. People rose from their
        seats and climbed onto the stage in a flurry of laughter
        and cheers.  The gifted young performers smiled.
           An overnight thunderstorm flooded the stage and
        damaged technical equipment, so that our second day
        began with a challenge – but it was one that, together,
        we could tackle. The Tennessee Children’s Dance
        Ensemble hiked up their dresses, dropped to their knees,
        and pushed puddles of rainwater off of the stage with
        their bare hands. Malachi Sameday, a talented young
        musician, selflessly offered his childhood drum set for
        all of the festival’s children to play on. The courage of
        children in the face of adversity is remarkable. From
        them, we are encouraged to do the impossible in the
        name of passion and for the sake of art, as art is a
        universal language transcending linguistic and cultural
        barriers alike.3

        What is a dream?  I like to define it as something we
        carry with us in our minds. We believe it, and it drives us.


        If we start helping our dream by doing things to take us
        in the direction of our dreams, we begin to exercise our
        talents and energy toward a vision. Dreams and visions
        are natural for humans because we are a creative species
        driven to explore, invent, discover. We each have our
        own ideas to follow and dreams to create.

                                                and found it to be culturally enriching, because of the variety of
