        drawing with crayons on his parents’ walls. Craig continued
        to work on his art (not only on walls!) and gradually got
        better at it. In spite of his expressive drawings with crayons
        and his parents’ encouragement, Craig never imagined that
        he would become a painter.
        Craig went to elementary and middle school in California.
        He says, “I remember when I was as young as eight, our

        with five drawings. We did this assignment one day a week.   basically how I went from jock to art student to painter,” he

        Craig focused on soccer in college and was offered
        an athletic scholarship. It was stressful for him to
        balance college classwork, soccer, and friendships,
        and his grades began to suffer. To help improve
