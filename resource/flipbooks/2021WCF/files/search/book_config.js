I enjoyed every    bit of it, although my first-time public speaking was not    as fun. I enjoy making art a lot because it always cheers    me up. It’s like making your own little paradise. You have    complete control over that little paradise, which makes it    very fun to draw. I decided to paint ice skating because I    do ice skating and it’s an important part of my life. As for    the photograph part of the painting, I must admit there    was no deep meaning behind that idea other than the fact    that my dad explained some stuff and then I thought it was    cool! My dad and mom also helped me along the journey.    I’m grateful they’ve gotten me so far. I would not be here    without them, and other people, too, like my art teachers    who made art so much fun for me and were so kind, giving    me a great and wonderful experience.

The topic of the Arts Olympiad was sports. The reason  I chose to paint a soccer player shooting a soccer ball is  because I really enjoy playing soccer and it is one of my  favorite sports. I enjoy having the ball up front because in a  game you don’t have those chances very often.  I was excited to come to Washington DC for the festival with  my family. It was the first time I have visited Washington  DC and I enjoyed it a lot. I liked that there were a lot of  fun activities at the festival and that you could go from  one station to another. There were activities such as rug  making, shoe design, making your own shirt, painting, and  more. Ideas can come from other ideas—when people look  at your art they can come up with their own ideas.  Something that I like about art is that it can show things  about you, such as what you like or how you are feeling. For  example, I am feeling happy right now about something. I  can make art about it to show how I feel. Art can also inspire  people to do something good in the world.  My mom, dad, and teacher encouraged me to participate in  the contest, and now I am really happy that I won!","OCT-DEC 2021 27             https://icaf.org","28 CHILDART 6TH WORLD CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL       TOP:     MICHELLE CHEN     AGE 12     CALIFORNIA, USA","OCT-DEC 2021 29                                                     BELOW:  KINGSTON SHENG-JUEI TSAI                                                     AGE 10                                                 TAIWAN                                                                        https://icaf.org","30 CHILDART 6TH WORLD CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL                                                                       BELOW:                                                     MEHIR BIRARI                                                                       AGE 10                                             CALIFORNIA, USA","OCT-DEC 2021 31    TOP:  JAN KOLUCKI  AGE 14  POLAND                 https://icaf.org","32 CHILDART 6TH WORLD CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL    MITHILESH MEHUL RAMCHANDANI, AGE 14, INDIA","OCT-DEC 2021 33    PRASHAM AMAR SHAH, AGE 11, INDIA                                      https://icaf.org","34 CHILDART 6TH WORLD CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL    pstorwokeersful        6TH ARTS OLYMPIAD WINNER      A L E X I S J O N O TA N, A G E 11      I love drawing and coloring. When I was a toddler, I loved to    doodle. I would draw anything, whenever an idea formed    in my head. My mom says that I could draw a pizza and an    angry bird even before I could write alphabet letters. I drew    not only on drawing papers, but also on sticky notes, books,    sidewalks, and to my mom’s dismay, on walls and carpets.    My poor mom regularly got to clean up my mess!    I have been drawing and coloring for as long as I can    remember. Art is not only a fun hobby but it is also a very    relaxing and soothing activity. Art allows me to be creative    and independent. I am in total control of my project and    free to express myself. It brightens my mood and gives me    a sense of accomplishment and pride when it is completed.    Most of all, art teaches me to look at the tiny details in life.    All the small details may not seem like a big deal, but once    you combine small details such as light, reflection, shadow,    stroke,color,andtexture,ononepieceofpaper,theartwork    becomesmorerealisticandbeautiful.Noticingsmalldetails    sharpens my mind and helps me solve problems in school    and in life.    I chose swimming for the topic of my artwork because    swimming has been a big part of my life. I have been on the    ARTWORK MARIA FERNANDA AGE 16 USA","OCT-DEC 2021 35    swim team for about four years, and I have always been  fascinated by the butterfly stroke. It is the most powerful  swim stroke and one of the most difficult strokes to master.  When a swimmer takes a breath in butterfly, it is both  powerful and beautiful.  I would like to thank my art teacher, Ms.Teh, who imparted  her creative knowledge to me. Thank you, ICAF judges,  for this honor to be one of the 6th Arts Olympiad winners.  It means so much to me that my artwork is admired and  appreciated. I had lots of fun at the WCF. It was nice meeting  new friends who share similar interests. I look forward to  the next WCF!

I enjoy art because I like to draw, paint,    dance, sing, and act. When I sketch a drawing, I start with    a general direction and allow the colors and pencils to    project my ideas. In the future, I want art to be a consistent    influence in my life. I plan to attend a performing arts high    school to help me toward my goal of becoming an actress.    During my time at the 2021 World Children’s Festival,    I enjoyed meeting the delegates from Nigeria and    participating in their workshops. I hope to participate in    the next WCF. I want to draw another piece of artwork    that showcases my talents and interests. I have been able    to work on my passion for drawing with Ms. Teh and Ms.    Leng at SKA Academy of Art and Design. In my winning    art piece, my art teachers helped me to think about my    interest in gymnastics and to capture small parts that I    enjoy in the sport.

The title of my art piece for the 6th   Arts Olympiad is Volleyball in Dismay or The Beginning. I   was immediately drawn to the 2021 Arts Olympiad theme,   “My Favorite Sport,” depicting artist-athletes because both   art and athletics are important parts of my life. Specifically,   my art piece represents that volleyball remained inviolable   throughout the struggle of COVID-19’s impact on my body.   I was crushed when I heard that I couldn’t play volleyball   all year due to COVID-19 lockdowns. My art shows a   lone player standing in a wrecked volleyball court. The   player is the only thing that is colored. The player emits a   slight aura, representative of light and hope amongst the   devastation. This shows that even though nowhere is safe,   there are people pushing through, making the world a little   better every day. As my sports stopped, my art continued.   The Cary Arts Center, National Gallery of Art, and North   Carolina Museum of Art began online art classes. These   became lights in my isolated COVID world; I replaced my   sport with art. Sport and art influence the brain, enabling   it to go through any challenge, even a pandemic. If you can’t   do one, do the other. Now, with sports returning, I can do so","OCT-DEC 2021 51    much more with art. Sports give you new ideas for making  art, and art gives you the strength to continue with sports.  By binding artistic creativity with athleticism, the world  could overcome any despair. In the future, I know art will  help me relax and remind me of the past.  EvenwiththedarknessthatCOVID-19brought,joyandhope  persevered when everyone worked together. Everyone can  participate, and I encourage all children everywhere to be  creative; you never know where it may take you!  ICAF is a great foundation. I am thankful for the WCF  experience. It lifted the spirits of people during these hard  times. I am grateful to Ms. Linda Simpson of the Cary Arts  Center who is an outstanding art educator and Ms. Lauren  Robbins-Pollack of the Cary School of Music, who is an  amazing music teacher. I would also like to thank my family  for their encouragement and for always pushing me in the  right direction.

On the first day, I was slightly nervous, because I didn’t know  how young kids who I had never met would react to a game  that is so complicated. I was worried that the kids might not be  interested because they would see the game for its faults—it  has too many rules, each game is quite long, and it is frustrating  to lose. I was amazed to see, however, that with every child  who engaged in learning chess, there was a brilliant connection  between the child’s brain and the game. Although it took a while  to teach each child how the pieces moved, and how strange  each rule was, they quickly understood the true essence of  the game—not necessarily winning, but using chess to inspire  creativity, novelty, and brilliance.","OCT-DEC 2021 67             https://icaf.org","68 CHILDART 6TH WORLD CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL    iinnssepcirtation       WORKSHOP: INSECTS, SOUNDS, AND ART       RYAN REYNOLDS    Necessity is the mother of invention.

Creativity is the most significant skill a kid  can have, and with all the time that kids have been spending at  home with nothing to do in the past year, it’s very important to  foster this skill. Quarantine has been hard for everyone, and it  has especially hindered how the children of today are growing  up. Before the pandemic, kids were free to go outside and  play in the sun or spend more time with their friends exploring.  However, even before the pandemic, there has been a trend  of children spending an increasing amount of time in front of  screens, which makes it even more important to foster their  growth and creativity with fun and easy crafts to enjoy.    The International Child Art Foundation is an international art and  creativity organization for children with the goal to give kids the  chance to explore the arts to ensure that the next generation  can think creatively and become innovators.    To help cultivate this creativity in children, we organized a tent  for t-shirt design at the World Children’s Festival. We collected  supplies—paint, markers, stencils, and anything else that  could be used to decorate—and grabbed plain t-shirts, and  we were ready to begin our craft. We set up the supplies and  invited people to be creative. It was inspiring to see the various  creative interpretations of one simple craft, as children reached  for the art supplies and let their creativity bleed into the shirts.  Whether it was a hand-drawn dinosaur, or a stencil-traced,  vibrant garden of flowers, the children were happy and smiling,  able to let their creativity loose and have the freedom to create  whatever they wanted.    It’s not a complicated craft. It’s something you can even set up  at home if you want to sit back, relax, and let your imagination","TO HELP CULTIVATE THIS                                                                               OCT-DEC 2021 71  CREATIVITY IN CHILDREN,  WE ORGANIZED A TENT                                    IT WAS INSPIRING TO SEE  FOR T-SHIRT DESIGN AT                                      THE VARIOUS CREATIVE  THE WORLD CHILDREN’S  FESTIVAL.

The event honors  young artists and those who foster their creativity. It  celebrates the rise of a new group of creative-empaths  who can work together to brighten the future. The three-  day festival has offered the opportunity for creative  children to gather to develop mutual empathy through  art as their native language.    The 6th WCF Awards Banquet was held at the Omni-  Shoreham Hotel in Washington, DC. This hotel became  famous when the Beatles stayed here on their first visit  to the United States. The venue is a befitting place to  celebrate the arts, talent, and new learning.    The banquet took place on August 2nd in the Diplomat  Room, modeled after the East Room of the White House.  Shisha McKee started the evening by encapsulating  her experiences with ICAF and the WCF over the past  twenty-four years before introducing nine-year-old  Liliana Beckwith from the Columbia Music School, who  performed her original song “Sunset.”    Following dinner, ICAF presented the Exceptional  Creativity Awards to the young artists. When the recipients  introduced themselves and spoke of their interests,  the guests learned that art is simply a manifestation  of creativity. The children were interested in becoming  scientists or doctors, specializing in artificial intelligence  or robotics, joining a soccer league, or winning the Grand  Slam in professional golf. Their interests were diverse,  yet they found harmony in shared experiences over the  three-day event.    Parents and the teachers spoke, expressing their  gratitude to ICAF for hosting the WCF, a transformative  experience for children, especially after eighteen long  months of COVID lockdowns. As we nurture the creativity  of today’s youth, we can all find cause to celebrate what  lies ahead.","OCT-DEC 2021 77    TAMANA MAJITHIA, AGE 11, CALIFORNIA, USA                                                                                                                    https://icaf.org","78 CHILDART 6TH WORLD CHILDREN’S FESTIVAL    CREDITS                                                                           PUBLISHER AND EDITOR                                                                         ASHFAQ ISHAQ                                                                         Ashfaq Ishaq founded the International Child Art Foundation in 1997 to plant the seeds of freedom                                                                         by cultivating creativity and growing mutual empathy.
