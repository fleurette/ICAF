                                    My name is Praveer Sharan, I am seventeen years old. In the 
summer of 2021, I visited Washington DC to teach a chess 
workshop at the World Children’s Festival (WCF) produced by 
the International Child Art Foundation (ICAF). While the festival 
and its workshops are primarily centered around art, I believe 
that the game of chess can be considered an art because it 
encourages creativity, out-of-the-box thinking, and innovation.
Chess is a beautiful game, and one that captured my attention 
as a child. When I was four years old, I was introduced to the 
game by watching my older brother, Pranav Sharan, play in 
Las Vegas. I was drawn to the idea that every single game is 
different, and I felt that with every game I was living a different 
story. I began playing consistently, staying up until 4:00 a.m. 
on some days after my parents had gone to sleep, playing 
game after game! The game was so fun to me, and I didn’t 
want to stop playing. I started playing competitively, winning 
a national chess championship in Atlanta in 2010 when I was 
six. However, the impact that chess had on my life was much 
deeper than winning competitions. It made me smarter, sharper, 
and more creative, as I had to find all kinds of ways to get 
myself out of losing positions and turn the game on its head. It 
also gave me sportsmanship skills and empathy. No one likes 
to lose, especially not a child. However, when you’re losing 
game after game, chess teaches you that you can’t take it out 
on anyone else and that you must always be respectful.
These personal experiences I had with chess at an early age, 
including its influence on my development, made me believe 
that it would be a perfect choice for teaching kids at the festival. 
On the first day, I was slightly nervous, because I didn’t know 
how young kids who I had never met would react to a game 
that is so complicated. I was worried that the kids might not be 
interested because they would see the game for its faults—it 
has too many rules, each game is quite long, and it is frustrating 
to lose. I was amazed to see, however, that with every child 
who engaged in learning chess, there was a brilliant connection 
between the child’s brain and the game. Although it took a while 
to teach each child how the pieces moved, and how strange 
each rule was, they quickly understood the true essence of 
the game—not necessarily winning, but using chess to inspire 
creativity, novelty, and brilliance. 
By far the most enjoyable times I had with the kids were when 
we began with this game with 400-year-old  rules and then 
came up with fun new twists that could make the game more 
interesting. One day, we experimented with a new type of four-
player chess, with teams of two. The types of games we played 
under those rules were so different than anything we had ever 
experienced before, but amazingly, the kids adapted to this 
new game and played it brilliantly. Every game was something 
new, and every minute some new tactic would be played. For 
some games, we would switch around all the pieces on the 
board and try to play from strange positions. The kids loved 
putting a twist on the rules, breaking new bounds in chess, and 
trying new things. On the third and last day, I was playing with 
two children. Instead of playing normal chess, I gave them the 
challenge to invent a new type of chess game that involved a 
die. Within seconds, the kids came up with a creative system 
for how the game should be played based on which number on 
the die was rolled, each number corresponding to a different 
piece or a different move.
The intelligence  that all  children  have is often overlooked 
because it  is unusual in the perspective of  older people. 
However, children have immense creativity, new perspectives, 
and an ability to push boundaries  in everything they come 
across—in this case, a simple game of chess.
